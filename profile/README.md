# Commune Stack
## Project Tl;Dr:
The point of this project is to create a platform for easy self-hosting of applications using a standard host-node program, web-assembly & javascript to provide a standard enviroment, and a standardised API for interfacing.

The host program runs headless in the taskbar and is managed through the web browser and uses sub-domains for different programs.
## MVP Goals:
* Install persistant programs through CLI

TODO: Finish this.
